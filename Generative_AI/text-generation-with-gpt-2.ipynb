Much like the autofill features on your iPhone/Android, GPT-2 is capable of next word prediction on a much larger and more sophisticated scale. For reference, the smallest available GPT-2 has 117 million parameters, whereas the largest one (invisible to the public) has over 1.5 billion parameters. The largest one available for public use is half the size of their main GPT-2 model**\n\n**ðŸ˜Š Transformers makes it very easy to import this model with both PyTorch and TensorFlow - in this notebook we will be using TensorFlow but it is just as easy in PyTorch.
